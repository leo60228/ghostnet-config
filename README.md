# CelesteServ
Currently running on `ghostnet.leo60228.space`. Celeste installation is **currently** not managed by NixOS, I'm planning to do this Eventuallyâ„¢ via DepotDownloader. FTB servers require connecting to the internet to install, and I was too lazy to find a stateless way to do this, someone else might have better luck. If you want to change the configuration (or perhaps even add a new service), simply submit a PR.
